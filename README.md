## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

With this small project I've learned that it's really easy to rush and go without caring about organization, but when you need to expand it later, or change something, it's really hard without a proper structure.

And I got better using flexbox, and positioning. I also tried doing it mobile-first (it's a lot easier and simpler).


### Continued development

I will research more about form validation (HTML and JS) and how to properly style input elements (height and width are weird in some of them). I will also learn more about algorithms and design patterns.
